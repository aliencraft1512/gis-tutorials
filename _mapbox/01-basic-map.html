title: Mapbox GL JS
subtitle: Basic Map
description: This is a blank map, with the built-in zoom and navigation controls, as well as the fullscreen control (not working correctly for this layout). Usually you would reference a Mapbox style url in the 'style' option, but that requires an API key. For the purposes of these tutorials, we will be using a blank map.
